## Dockerhub Rate

A small Go program that returns the [Dockerhub rate](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/#how-can-i-check-my-current-rate) of an unauthenticated user.

According to [Dockerhub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/#i-dont-see-any-ratelimit-headers) you will not see any rate limits as authenticated Dockerhub user.
